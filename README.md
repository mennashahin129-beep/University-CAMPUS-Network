# University-CAMPUS-Network
Campus Network Design is a network project that simulates a university campus network using VLAN segmentation, inter-VLAN routing, and WAN connectivity between a Main Campus and Branch Campus. The project includes network services such as DHCP, DNS, Web, and FTP, with basic security configurations to improve network performance and management.
